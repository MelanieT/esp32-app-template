# base_console
A console basis that can be used for both C and C++ programs on ESP32

This component provides the basic functionality of a comand console. It is used in conjunction with uart-console and/or telnetd-bsd as communication providers.

It is used by console-cpp, a CPP wrapper that makes using the console simple.
